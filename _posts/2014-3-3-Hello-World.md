title: Perro's first blog post!
---

This is a test blog post for now, so i'll put in some demo images so as to make this blog post appear slightly more legitimate.

For now I'll briefly talk about what i've read on [The Tangled Web](https://www.nostarch.com/tangledweb), a wonderful book written by [Michal Zalewski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micha%C5%82_Zalewski)

The book briefly introduces the reader to the 3 basic most prominent philosophies in cyber security:
* __Formal Solutions__
Here, Zalewski describes how both the academic and professional sides of cyber security, through thorough questioning of definitions, fail to come up with a satisying answer as to what exactly a "secure system" should be. Often times, Security practitioners find themselves left  with vague instructions on how cyber security should be implemented.

* __Risk Management__

This section of the post tests links, follow this link to go buy some [NoStarch books](https://www.nostarch.com/catalog/security), they're pretty good!
